# Digital Twin + Phone App
The boat's orientation changes according to the sensors on the phone. The idea is to have the phone in the boat with the app. The app sends data to a server (node.js) which then sends it to this web client. "Espectators" in this website can see how the boat is moving on the sea.

The app is developed with react-native. The transmition of data is done through websockets.
